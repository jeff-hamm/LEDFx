Provides a clean interface for common LED lighting effects tasks.The library is designed to be non - blocking so that you can attend to sensors and other code paths without waiting for LED effects to complete.

Features
Quickly get your lighting working, so you can focus on the other parts of your project!
Non - blocking loops.Keep your sensor / application code isolated from your lighting code without requiring the use the Arduino interrupt system.
Library of pre - written lighting effects
Works well with the fantastic FastLED library(https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) to work efficiently on a large number of chipsets.
Easy to write custom effects.
Teensy 3, 3.1  and Arduino Support
Supports dividing a single strip into multiple logical ranges and seamlessly apply effects to any single range.

Adding an effect to your LED Strip is as easy as creating a effects class, setting it's framerate, and looping an update.
